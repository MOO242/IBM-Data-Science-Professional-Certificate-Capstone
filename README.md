# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone 🚀  

This repository contains my capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
The project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills — from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis, visualisation, and building predictive models.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
- **Objective:** Apply data science methodology to solve a real‑world problem using Python and SQL.  
- **Dataset:** SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data  
- **API:** [SpaceX REST API (v4/rockets)](https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/rockets)  
- **Web Scraping:** [Wikipedia – Falcon 9 & Falcon Heavy launches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches)  
- **Key Tasks:**  
  - Data collection (API, web scraping, or CSV import)  
  - Data wrangling and cleaning  
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Data visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
  - Predictive modelling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM)  
  - Model evaluation and comparison

## 📥 Data Collection & Preparation  
- Pulled structured rocket and launch information from the SpaceX API.  
- Scraped Wikipedia for historical launch records and outcomes.  
- Merged and cleaned datasets, standardised formats, and handled missing values.  
- Produced a final dataset ready for analysis and modelling.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit‑learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, IBM Cloud, RESTful APIs

# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone 🚀

This repository contains my capstone project for the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
The project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills — from data collection and cleaning, to exploratory analysis, visualization, and building predictive models.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Apply data science methodology to solve a real-world problem using Python and SQL.
- **Dataset:** [Insert dataset name/source here, e.g., SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data].
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Data collection (API, web scraping, or CSV import)
  - Data wrangling and cleaning
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
  - Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN, SVM)
  - Model evaluation and comparison

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, IBM Cloud, RESTful APIs

## 📊 Results
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict [insert target variable, e.g., Falcon 9 landing success].
- Visualized key insights for decision-makers using interactive plots.
- Compared model performance using accuracy, confusion matrices, and other metrics.
